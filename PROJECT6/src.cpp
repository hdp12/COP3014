/*      PROGRAM : Soft Drink Vending Machine 
Simulation

FSU MAIL NAME: <hdp12>
RECITATION SECTION NUMBER: <009>
RECITATION INSTRUCTOR NAME: <Danny>
COP 3014 - Fall 2013    
PROJECT NUMBER: 6
DUE DATE: Wednesday 12/04/2013
PLATFORM: Windows OS / C++ 11 / Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2012 IDE

SUMMARY

This program simulates a soft drink vending machine. The program will work with drink names, 
their prices, and the current number available in the machine.
Each time the program runs, it will enter a loop that performs the following steps: 
a list of drinks and their prices is displayed on the screen. 
The user is then allowed to either quit the program or pick a drink. 
If the user selects a drink, the program will notify the user that $1.00 must be entered for payment. 
The program will then display the amount of change that would be returned and subtract one from the number of drinks left in the machine for that drink. 
If the user selects a drink that is sold out, a message to that effect will be displayed. 
The loop then repeats. 

When the user chooses to quit the program, the program will display the total amount of profit the machine earned during the current run. The profit on each can is calculated as $0.25 per can, for all drinks. After the user has quit and the program has printed out the total profit, it will then sort the array of structs containing the drinks into descending numeric order according to the number of cans of each drink which are available. Then, print out a summary table of the machine's final state, which includes the drink names, prices, and cans available in the machine at that point.



INPUT

machine.txt
The user can either pick a drink or quit the program
choice of drink (1 through 6), or the command to quit (0)

OUTPUT

a list of drinks and their prices is displayed on the screen. 
If the user selects a drink, the program will notify the user that $1.00 must be entered for payment. 
The program will then display the amount of change that would be returned and subtract one from the number of drinks left in the machine for that drink. 
If the user selects a drink that is sold out, a message to that effect will be displayed.
It will print out a summary table of the machine's final state, which includes the drink names, prices, and cans available in the machine at that point.
